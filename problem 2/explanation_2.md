I used recursion because A. we could have solved this problem with a for loop and B. there was a base condition that
could be met (travers all directories/files)

Time complexity: O(m*n) m being the directories/subdirectories, n being the number of files in those directories
Space Complexity: O(m*n) dependent on the amount of subdirectories and the number of files in those directories that meet
our criteria
